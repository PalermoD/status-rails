<h3>What is Status?</h3>
<hr/>
<p>
    Status is a global network that allows users to create, manage, join and monetize their own social networks and content on one platform. Status is a group of different and diverse communities generated by users, and a platform that allows people to come together to create interactive communities around a shared interest or affiliation. Users are able to hop between networks and follow other users from those networks in their main feed. Status lets you create & join the communities you want in one place!
